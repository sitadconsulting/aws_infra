We at SitadConsulting, are delighted and grateful to God Almighty for enabling us make this piece of work available today for public use 

In this repository, you will find a series of Terraform modules particularly for AWS and Kubernetes Providers.
These modules are based around the concept we coined Terraform "micro-module". With this approach we set the basic unit of a Terraform module to a resource object.

Thanks to the innovative work by the folks at Hashi, we have leveraged both locals and the for_each constructs as core part of this Terraform micro-module idea. This we believe
allows for a more expressive way in defining highly complex cloud infrastructure solutions from composable micro-modules. furthermore, it allowed us to decouple the code base from the configuration required to build out the infrastructure

We have provided a usage example of this idea in which we have deployed a secure containerized NGINX Web Server instance. You will find this example under the directory "projects/proj12".
You will find a companion document that captures the implementation details in the docs directory.

We'd love for you to engage and explore the set of currently available modules and provided example. We'd also love to hear from you, so please feel free to provide any 
feedback of observations, comments and any errors you encounter. You can reach us at this holding email address: gbkehinde@gmail.com. If you are also in a position to
address any error you notice that would be highly appreciated.

Our goal for making this available to the public is to help businesses seeking to mordernize in the cloud or adopt cloud services for the first time leverage the resouces we 
have provided to accelerate thier journey. As a company, we are committed to seeing enterprises thrive and succeed in the shift to adopting or modernizing in the cloud.
We are here to help. Please feel free to reach out to us at the holding email address above if you like to engage our service.

We would love to continue to make more of this work available for public use, if you share our ideals and would love to help, we would like to hear from you.
please reach out to us at the same email address above.

Thank you and fare well.
