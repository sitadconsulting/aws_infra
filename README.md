# **Acknowledgement**

We at SitadConsulting, are delighted and grateful to God Almighty for enabling us make this piece of work available today for public use. 

# **Introduction**
In this repository, you will find a series of Terraform modules particularly for AWS and Kubernetes Providers.
These modules are based around the concept we coined Terraform "micro-module". With this approach we set the basic unit of a Terraform module to a resource object.

Thanks to the innovative work by the folks at Hashi, we have leveraged both locals and the for_each constructs as core part of this Terraform micro-module idea. This we believe
allows for a more expressive way in defining highly complex cloud infrastructure solutions from composable micro-modules. furthermore, it allowed us to decouple the code base from the configuration required to build out the infrastructure

# **Usage Examples**

We have provided usage examples of this idea with companion implementation guide in the docs directory of each project. Follow the link below to access each project directory, you will find corresponding implementation guide in the docs folder.

 + [Building A Secure Containerized Nginx Web Server With EKS Container Orchestration Platform](projects/proj12)
